# PSQL queries

General:

* [Normalize](./normalize.md) - count total number of documents, pages and words per year.

Keyword searches:
* [Count number of occurrences of keywords (pages) and group by year](./keysearch_by_year.md)

**Note**: For running any of above queries, they need NLS pages to be stored previously in PSQL using [this query](../docs/nls/write_pages_df_psql.md)
